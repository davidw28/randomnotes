Overview:
- Windows 10 works officially and for free
- If you have Windows 11 or Windows Server, you can use unofficial methods to install them
- Windows 11 has unmet security requirements which you must bypass during installation
- Windows Server has looser requirements but installation may require an external keyboard

Windows 10:
- Easy, use Boot Camp Assistant (official method)
- Run Apple Software Update, restart and repeat until no further updates
- Run Windows Update, restart and repeat until no further updates

Upgrade to Windows 11: https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/18ht14d/boot_camp_easy_install_and_upgrade_for_windows_11/
- Save Windows support software to a USB from Boot Camp Assistant
- Install and fully update Windows 10 as above
- Download and mount the Windows 11 ISO
- Run CMD as Administrator
- Execute "D:" or whatever the letter of the mounted ISO is
- Execute "setup.exe /product server" to run the installer with relaxed hardware requirement checks
- After Windows 11 is installed, run setup.exe in the Windows support software to install Apple software for your device

Upgrade to Windows Server (with at least an external keyboard):
- Save Windows support software to a USB from Boot Camp Assistant
- Install and fully update Windows 10 as above
- Download and mount the Windows Server ISO
- Open setup.exe to run the installer
  - An external keyboard may be required, as the keyboard and touchpad did not work for me out of the box.
  - An external mouse will get you through the installer, but may not let you past the ctrl-alt-del requirement on the login page
- After Windows Server is installed, run setup.exe in the Windows support software to install Apple software for your device

Upgrade to Windows Server (with all Apple drivers installed out of the box):
- Save Windows support software to a USB from Boot Camp Assistant
- Install and fully update Windows 10 as above
- Create the folders "ISO", "Mount" and "Drivers" in a directory
- Download and mount the Windows Server ISO
- Copy all the files from the mounted Windows Server ISO to the "ISO" folder
- Run CMD as Administrator
- Execute "Export-WindowsDriver –Online -Destination DRIVERSPATH" to extract third-party drivers to the "Drivers" folder
- Execute "Get-WindowsImage -ImagePath ISOPATH\install.wim" to find the index of the version of Windows you wish to install
- Execute "Mount-WindowsImage -Path MOUNTPATH -ImagePath ISOPATH \install.wim -Index INDEX" to mount the copied ISO in the "Mount" folder
- Execute "Add-WindowsDriver -Path MOUNTPATH -Driver DRIVERSPATH -Recurse -ForceUnsigned" to install the drivers on this ISO
- Execute "Dismount-WindowsImage -Path MOUNTPATH –Save" to unmount and save changes to this ISO
- Use a third-party software to turn the folder "Mount" into an ISO. You do not need to make this ISO bootable
- Mount the new ISO and run setup.exe to install
- After Windows Server is installed, run setup.exe in the Windows support software to install Apple software for your device
